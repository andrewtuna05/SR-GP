# Single Image Super-Resolution Algorithm 

An implementation of the Single Image Super Resolution algorithm. 
The motivation for this project was to explore applications of Gaussian Processes and develop a simple framework for examples of image reconstruction. 
The notebooks provide a comparison of a variety of kernels via performance metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, benchmarking against the standard Bicubic Interpolation.
