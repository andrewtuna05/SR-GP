# Super-Resolution Algorithm 

An implementation of the Super-resolution algorithm using Gaussian Processes. This project was motivated to explore applications of Gaussian Processes. 
Focused on testing a variety of kernels and comparing performance via PSNR and SSIM, benchmarking against Bicubic Interpolation.
