# Super-Resolution Algorithm 

An implementation of the Super-resolution algorithm using Gaussian Processes. This project was motivated to explore applications of Gaussian Processes. 
The focus is applying the algorithm and comparing a variety of kernels through performance metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, benchmarking against the standard Bicubic Interpolation.
